%the genesets are already written nicely and ordered by reaction, so there
%is no need to assign each geneset to a reaction, so there is no need to
%use the following code. We only need to convert "AND" into "and", "OR"
%into "or" because of how associate_genes_reactions.m is written

%% WARNING: we can remove brackets only in Recon because brackets are only used for gene names and not for associative rules between AND and OR. Strangely there is no associativity in the grRules!
%However, in general, to avoid problems I am substituting all the '((' and
%'))' (that are the useful brackets because the first '(' is part of the associative rules, while the second '(' is part of the gene name) with '[' and ']' to save them
% then I am removing all the '(' and ')', 
%and finally I am substituting back '[' and ']' with '(' and ')' respectvely. 
% This way, all the useless brackets part of the gene names are
%removed, while the useful brackets are kept
