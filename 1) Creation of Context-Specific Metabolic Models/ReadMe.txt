For differential gene expression profiles, refer to the Gene Expression Profiles.xlsx. For the CAI calculations, refer to the CAI_calculations.xlsx.

To construct the metabolic models, generate the geni and reaction_expression files using compute_reaction_expression.m. Next, to find growth rate in different conditions, use the Fbamodel_runcode.m
